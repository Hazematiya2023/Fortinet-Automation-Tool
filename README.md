Advanced FortiGate Cloning & Management Tool

¬Æ Developed by Hazem Mohamed - Cybersecurity Engineer | LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/hazem-mohamed-03742957/



****This Tool was developed using my skills in PowerShell scripting and enhanced by Google Gemini Flash Pro 2.5****

A powerful PowerShell GUI tool designed to streamline and automate the management of FortiGate firewalls. This tool transforms repetitive, time-consuming tasks into a few simple clicks, significantly boosting productivity and reducing the risk of human error.

What started as a simple policy cloner has evolved into an integrated management hub, built through a collaborative development process.

‚ú® Key Features

This tool is packed with intelligent features designed for real-world network administration scenarios:

    Bulk Cloning:

        Clone multiple Firewall Policies at once.

        Clone multiple Policy Routes at once.

    Bulk Status Management:

        Enable or Disable multiple Firewall Policies or Policy Routes simultaneously.

    Smart Interface Handling:

        Select new interfaces (input, output, srcintf, dstintf) once and apply the change to all selected items in a single operation.

    Advanced Search & Filtering:

        Instantly find any policy or route by its ID, Name, Source Address, or Destination Address. This allows you to quickly isolate and manage specific rules.

    Intelligent Name Handling:

        Automatically handles long policy names by adding a Copy_of_ prefix and truncating the original name if it exceeds FortiGate's 35-character limit, preventing errors.

    VDOM Aware:

        Full support for Virtual Domains (VDOMs). Simply enter the VDOM name to manage its specific policies and routes.

    Professional & Flexible UI:

        A clean, resizable graphical interface with a scrollable layout that adapts to any screen size.

        Includes a real-time log viewer to monitor all operations.

        Features a "Disconnect" button to safely terminate the SSH session and reset the UI, allowing you to connect to another device without restarting.
